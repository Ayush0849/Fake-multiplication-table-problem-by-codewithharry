# Fake-multiplication-table-problem-by-codewithharry
 Rohan das is a fraud by nature. Rohan Das wrote a python function to print a multiplication table of a given number and put one of the values (randomly generated) as wrong.  Rohan Das did this to fool his classmates and make them commit a mistake in a test. You cannot tolerate this!  So you decided to use your python skills to counter Rohan’s actions by writing a python program that validates Rohan’s multiplication table.  Your function should be able to find out the wrong values in Rohan’s table and expose Rohan Das as a fraud
